# Image Captioning Project

This project implements a deep learning model for generating captions for images. It combines computer vision
 techniques with natural language processing to automatically describe the contents of images in textual form.

## Overview

Image captioning is achieved using a neural network architecture that integrates both visual and textual information. The model takes an image as input and generates a descriptive caption as output, leveraging techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) like LSTMs for sequence modeling of captions.

## Key Components

- **Data Preparation**: Captions associated with images are preprocessed and tokenized using a tokenizer to convert text into numerical sequences.

- **Model Architecture**: The neural network consists of:
  - **Image Feature Extraction**: CNN layers process image features.
  - **Sequence Processing**: Embedding layers and LSTM units handle textual sequences.
  - **Decoder**: Combines image and sequence features to predict the next word in captions.
  
- **Training**: The model is trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer over multiple epochs. Training data is fed in batches using a custom data generator for efficiency.
